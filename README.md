# Face_Detection

Face Detection With OpenCV Python Library and Haarcascade-frontalface Dataset

* this project was created as final university Project *

in this project we made an Ai model that can detect human face. 
if you run script, your webcam is turning on, so the model can see your face and detect are you human or not (we hope you are!).
for training our model, we use Haarcascade-frontalface Dataset AND OpenCV Python Library that is so capable to do Face Detection.
